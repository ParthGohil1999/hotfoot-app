Both beds were comfortable, and the room was quiet (so nice after the business outside) and very clean. Nice bathroom with a great shower.\nThere were so many things included in the room- chocolates, crackers, wine, soft drinks, and water in a cute red recycled plastic “London” bottle, it felt like such a treat!\nThey seemed to be making efforts in sustainability- we noticed a water refill station, reusable water bottle, and refillable toiletries.\nBreakfast was fresh and tasty and had a wide selection of choices.\nWe chose room service for dinner which came from the in house restaurant. Portions were huge and the food was really lovely, with plenty of choices suitable for children.\nLocation is great- it’s a quick walk from Convent Garden, the Embankment and Westminster.\nStaff were friendly and helpful, they looked after our bags for us both before checked in and after we checked out so we could go shopping without carrying everything.\nI thoroughly recommend a stay here, we loved it.",

I’m so glad I did – it exceeded all my expectations.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was fortunate enough to check in earlier than the usual time, which was a lovely surprise. My room was exactly as I had hoped: very clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. I truly felt at home, which is rare and much appreciated.\n\nThe hotel’s location is absolutely perfect, right in the heart of London. I couldn’t have asked for a better spot – everything is within easy reach, making getting around a breeze. The room service was also excellent: quick and with top-quality food.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to try the breakfast this time, but I look forward to doing so on my next visit!\n\nOn the day of my departure, I was able to leave my luggage at the hotel so I could enjoy my last day in London without any hassle, which was a great bonus. The staff were all incredibly attentive, friendly, and helpful. Special thanks to Mary and Gigi for their kindness and professionalism.\n\nAs London is my favourite city, I know for sure that whenever I return, the Strand Palace Hotel will be my go-to place! A big thank you to the entire team for making my stay unforgettable.",
